If you are looking for an **EDIFACT Parser** that transforms your [EDIFACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDIFACT) into [XML/EDIFACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML/EDIFACT) and vice versa, you reach an interesting site ;-)

My code is running at http://parse-edifact.net/ and I am still wondering if I sould open the source code... Any feedback is welcome!

On the other hand, I have started to document/explain what I have done, see my [Architecture](Architecture.md) Wiki page.
